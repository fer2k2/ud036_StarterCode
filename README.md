# Movie Trailer Website

Movie Trailer Website is the first project for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.
it uses the Fresh Tomatoes script provided by Udacity. The purpose of the project is to generate a local website on the fly that shows trailers of different movies.

### New Features

I added some new features to the required by the course:

* Movies are loaded using a CSV file called movies.csv
* Duration, director and year are shown together with movie title
* Changed the page name to International Tomatoes! due to the movies I'm showing

### How to run

Requires Python 2.7.x to run.

Just open any Windows, Mac or Linux terminal and run:

```sh
python entertainment_center.py
```

**Thanks**
